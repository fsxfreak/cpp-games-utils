# isabel-game
My version of my student's game. Teachers can learn too.

# notes
- problem! rooms create their own doors, which differ by left/right room pointer
	- when door is already created, give other room the door too?

### representing items
- have one overall item class
- have item component classes that can be added into item that differentiate item
	- Item -> cosmetic, edible, unlocker, ingredient, etc
- for unlocker items
	- Generate unique id that matches item to a door
